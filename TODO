TODO:

- syntax
    - the syntax should support (even though it would be ignored) ;
    - the syntax should support FROM

- LIKE support

- functions
    - the Function item in queryparse.y is icky, only allowing
        0,1,2,3-ary functions. Should allow n-ary functions.
        - this requires more complex data structures to achieve
    - aggregation functions

- types
    - lots of mixing of num vs long vs integer, dbl vs float vs double
        - clean these up
    - the val.is_foo bools are icky; should be an enum instead

- support for date/time type

- unit tests

- support headers/header files

- support column indexing 
    - requires typing
    - save a sorted (len)key:value store of (char[64])hashed_column:(unsigned int)seekval
        - hashed_column is an md5 hash of the column value
        - seekval is the index of the start of the row in reference
    - contains a header of rowcount 

- support joins
    - indexed joins forced on any CSV larger than 100 lines.
